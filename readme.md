Supports listing and filtering issues, viewing issue details,
modifying certain properties, and adding worklogs.

Additionally, it provides support for displaying all worklogs from the
[Tempo](https://www.tempo.io/products/jira-time-tracking) integration.

## Installation
This package is available in [MELPA](https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa),
so you just need to do:

```elisp
(use-package jira
  :config
  (setq jira-base-url "https://acme.atlassian.net") ;; Jira instance URL
  (setq jira-username "johndoe@acme.com") ;; Jira username (usually, an email)
  ;; API token for Jira
  ;; See https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/
  (setq jira-token "foobar123123")
  (setq jira-token-is-personal-access-token nil)
  (setq jira-api-version 3) ;; Version 2 is also allowed
  ;; (Optional) API token for JIRA TEMPO plugin
  ;; See https://apidocs.tempo.io/
  (setq jira-tempo-token "foobar123123"))
```

You can also install it using
[straight.el](https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el)

```elisp
(use-package jira
  :straight (:host github :repo "unmonoqueteclea/jira.el")
  :demand t
  :config ...)
```

## Authentication
`jira.el` supports two methods for authenticating with the Jira REST API:

1.  **Configuration variables:** You can directly set the
    `jira-username` and `jira-token` variables (and `jira-tempo-token`
    if you use it) in your Emacs configuration (e.g., your `init.el`
    or `config.el`).  This is often the simplest way to get started.

    ```elisp
      (setq jira-username "johndoe@acme.com") ;; Jira username (usually, an email)
	  ;; API token for Jira
	  ;; See https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/
	  (setq jira-token "foobar123123")
    ```

    While convenient, storing your token directly in your Emacs
    configuration can pose a security risk if your configuration file
    is not properly protected. Consider using `auth-source` for more
    secure storage.

2.  **`auth-source`:** This is the recommended and more secure
    method. `auth-source` is an Emacs library for managing
    credentials.  It allows you to store your Jira username and API
    token in a secure location (like `~/.authinfo.gpg`) and `jira.el`
    will retrieve them when needed.

    -  **Configure `auth-source`:** Add an entry to your
    `~/.authinfo` or `~/.authinfo.gpg` file (create the file if it
    doesn't exist).

	```
	machine acme.atlassian.net login johndoe@acme.com port https password foobar123123
	```

	And, if you use `tempo.io`:

	```
	machine tempo.io port https password foobar123123
	```

    **`jira.el` will automatically use `auth-source` if `jira-username` and `jira-token` are not explicitly set.**

	⚠️ If you are using a Jira [**Personal Access Token (PAT)**](https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/using-personal-access-tokens-1026032365.html) instead
    of an **API Token**, you will need to set `jira-token-is-personal-access-token`:

	```elisp
	(setq jira-token-is-personal-access-token t)
	```

🌐 For multiple Jira hosts, add entries for each host in your auth-source file and
configure `jira-secondary-urls`. Press `H` in the issues list to switch between hosts.

## Quickstart
Use `M-x jira-issues` to check the list of issues assigned to the
configured user for the active sprint. Once the list is loaded, press
`?` to see the available actions. You can modify the filters, update
the selected issue, add worklogs, and more.

Press `l` to select the filters to be applied to the list of
issues. You can filter by several fields, use one of your starred filters,
or even write your own `JQL` filter.

If you configured [Tempo integration](https://www.tempo.io/), you can
also run `jira-tempo` to view the list of worklogs for the current
week.

## FAQ

- ❓ **Does it work with my old on-premise instance?**

	I try to provide support as much as possible, but I don’t have access to this kind of
	JIRA installation, so I rely on the official documentation and user PRs and issues.
	If you’re using API version 2, make sure to set `jira-api-version` (see the
	**Customization** section). Version `v2.8.2` fixes an issue with older on-premise
	instances related to the endpoint that lists issues. I’m also working on making issue
	transitions work (see https://github.com/unmonoqueteclea/jira.el/issues/37).

## Customization

This is the list of customizations you can set:

- `jira-base-url`: **Mandatory**: Jira instance URL, like: https://acme.atlassian.net
- `jira-username`: Jira username (usually, an email)

   - ⚠️ Some Jira instances only allow REST API version 2

- `jira-users-max-results`:  Maximum number of Jira usernames to retrieve (default: `1000`)

   Allowed values are defined in `jira-issues-fields`. Example:
   `'(:key :issue-type-name :status-name :assignee-name :progress-percent :work-ratio
      :remaining-time :summary)`
- `jira-issues-max-results`: Maximum number of Jira issues to retrieve
- `jira-tempo-max-results`: Maximum number of Tempo worklogs to retrieve

  '((t (:foreground "white" :background "orange" :weight bold)))
